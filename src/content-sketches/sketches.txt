Here are more benefits we gain:
- build trust on code base
- discover interestnig edgecase that will help to define better user experience
- helps to keep better app structure: encourages to keep function small, pure, simply, readable, detatched from complex app structure
- provide to having tests that are fast and not fragile
- we discovered that trivial functions are not as trivial as they first seem
