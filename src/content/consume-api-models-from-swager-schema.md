**TypeScript** is awesome. Like **i18next** too. It works with TypeScript great but has one drawback. We need to provide a translation key as a plain string. It doesn't matter for small apps, but it does indeed for complex one when your translation file start to have hundreds of lines.

Thanks for reading.
